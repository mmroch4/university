     Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is a computer bus interface that connects HDD, SSD and CD/DVD drives to computers.
     Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVME) is a protocol for highly parallel data transfer with reduced system overheads per I/O.
8. - What is ISA, EISA, PCI, PCI-E?
     Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) was a computer network standard created in 1981. It is a simple channel for the many circuitry and devices that can be connected to a motherboard to exchange data.
     Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) is a bus structure extending the ISA from 16 to 32 bits.
     Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) is a local computer bus attaching hardware devices in a computer and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard.
     Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI-E) is a standards-based, point-to-point, serial interconnect used to link a computer to peripherals.
9. - What is HDD and SSD?
     A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a type of data storage device that holds data in a magnetic disk.
     Solid State Drive (SSD) stores data in flash memory.
10. - What is USB, Firewire, Thunderbolt?
      Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard that established specifications for connectors, cables and protocols for communication, connection and power supply between computers and peripherals.
      Firewire is a connection cable that enables high-speed communication between two separate computers or between a computer and a peripheral developed by Apple.
      Thunderbolt is a high-speed I/O interface that allows to connect various peripheral devices to a computer.
11. - What is VGA, DVI, HDMI?
      Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a standard display interface used to connect video output devices to computers and projectors to display monitors and TVs.
      Digital Visual Interface (DVI) is an interface which is used to transmit video signals whether analogue or digital.
      High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is an interface used to transmit high-qualify audio and video signals between devices.
12. - What is Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth?
      Ethernet is a communication protocol that allow network-connected devices to talk to one another without talking over each other.
      Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that allow devices to interface with the Internet.
